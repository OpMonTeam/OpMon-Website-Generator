Hello everyone, and welcome to OpMon new website! We wanted to transition from
the old one since some time now, and the recent progress on the Godot version of
OpMon gave us the perfect occasion.

So yeah, as some of you may be aware we recently switched from [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to develop OpMon. We're currently getting
up to speed with the old version of the project.

We'll try to keep you updated with the development progress, so stay tuned!
