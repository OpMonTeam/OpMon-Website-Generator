Alpha 0.3 has been released!

## In the game
You can see [Alpha 0.3 announcement](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/49) to see what has been done.

## In the future
I’ll now start working on the Alpha 0.4, you can find the roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/OpMonTeam/projects/11). I’ll first search for new tiles on the Internet to improve Euvi Town, then I’ll work on the items!

**Important note:** I’ve been thinking last weeks, and as you can see this development report is quite empty. To be honest, I’m not working on this game as often as a professional would do, so I don’t think monthly development reports are required. However, I still think it’s important to give news regularly, so I’ll still do development reports, but every season. Consider this the development report of the summer solstice, and we’ll see again at the autumnal equinox.

## In my life
Even though I haven’t worked on the game since the last release (personal issues), the working rhythm I had during May seemed right to me and I think I’ll try to continue like this when I can. However, some important events will be happening for me in the next months, and I don’t think I’ll work at all from the last week of June until the start of August (maybe one or two commits if I crave developing the game and have the time). I’ll be completely free again during August until September (when I’ll start a new year of studies).

As always, thanks for following the development of OpMon.
