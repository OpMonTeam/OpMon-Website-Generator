Hello there! We finally caught up the C++ version with the new Godot one! For this occasion, the repository has been reorganized and a lot of things have changed. We also released Alpha 0.2.0.  

For more information, you can read the [monthly report of March 2022](https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/37), since yes, monthly reports are back! Except this first one, all monthly reports will also be posted on the website.

Thank you for following the development of OpMon!
