Well I should have done this announcement months ago, but better late than never: I’m pausing my contributions to the game from now on until this summer. The job I’ve started this year coupled with my studies leaves me no time to work on the game anymore.

If you still want to contribute, I’ll still be able to check pull requests and issues, and answer your questions here or on the Discord server. I will not, however, contribute anything to the game myself in the meanwhile.

Happy 2023 and see you in June!
